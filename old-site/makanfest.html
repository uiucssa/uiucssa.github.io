                UIUC Singapore Students Association proudly presents Makanfest 2017, our annual food festival where we bring to you delicacies from our Garden City. Food is a huge part of Singaporean culture, and what better way to learn more about it than to taste it! Along with us are the Indonesian and Vietnamese Student's Associations, each featuring a local dish to give you a glimpse of the amazing food in South East Asia.
