Happy August!

Hoping that summer is going great for you. School begins in less than a month and we hope that you are almost ready to head back to the land of lincoln. To our fellow friends heading to UIUC for the first time, don't forget to get some of the recommended listed in our [Illini Handbook](http://www.uiucssa.com/attach/fighting-illini-book-2016.pdf)!

Over the past months, UIUC SSA has organized several outreach event to share about our school as a top choice to pursue your education. on July 9, we headed down to NUS U-town as part of the USA predepature event supported by OSU. Over the last weekend (23 July), we set up a booth and took questions from the public about life in our school and the education there. Here are some photos for you to catch up on the events.

On July 30, we hosted a BBQ at a fellow alumni's house and reminded ourselves of some illini spirit amongst the fellow Singaporeans who have chose to experience life in our quiet little town.

When we return to UIUC, we will be having a series of activities, so keep peeled to our facebook group and website to stay updated with the events. We will also be organizing our annual Chicago Labor Day trip where we drive up to Chicago to explore the city together and visit the outlet mall to shop!

Till then, have a great remaining month and happy National Day in advance!
