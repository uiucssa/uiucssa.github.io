Today, the UIUC SSA held Illini Day 2016 at Furama Riverfront to welcome new students and exchange students headed to UIUC this Fall 2016. A big Thank You to our sponosors: Furama Group, Overseas Singapore Unit and ContactSG for making this event possible.

Another warm welcome to everyone and the SSA wishes your time in UIUC to be an enjoyable one. Explore the different land and culture, and always feel comfortable to have a familiar community of Singaporeans in the heart of Urbana-Champaign. Keep peeled for updates and our exciting events!

Note: The Presentation slides can be found under `Resources`
