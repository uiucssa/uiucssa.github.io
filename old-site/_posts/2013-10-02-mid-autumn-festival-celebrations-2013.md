The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Singapore Students Association, together with the Malaysian Students Association, jointly celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival on 21st Sep. With almost two hundred people – a substantial portion of which were non-Chinese – turning up, the event proved a great way to socialize, introduce others to our culture, and celebrate one of the, if not most significant, then certainly most fun holidays in Chinese culture.

No Mid-Autumn Festival celebration is complete without mooncakes, of course, and we had flavours aplenty. Sparklers, handheld lanterns and “kongming” lanterns rounded out the festive atmosphere and helped create the atmosphere of a home, away from home.
